# PomodoroMobile

### _A React Native tech demo_

This application is a simple tech demo implementation of a Pomodoro Timer written in React Native.

The Pomodoro Method is a system of time management designed to help you focus on a task, by limiting the time spent focusing, and allowing for frequent breaks. The typical time lengths, and the one used by this app, consists of 25-minute work periods, each followed by a 5-minute rest. After the fourth consecutive work period, the work is followed by a longer 15-minute break.

This is an Expo app. You can run the app yourself with

`npx expo start`
